# Automated CI/CD pipeline :<br>

This robust pipeline covers everything from code checkout to deployment, ensuring our applications are built, tested, and deployed seamlessly.<br>

Here’s a quick rundown of the stages:<br>
𝗚𝗶𝘁 𝗖𝗵𝗲𝗰𝗸𝗼𝘂𝘁 - Fetching the latest code.<br>
𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗮𝗹𝗹 𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗲𝗻𝗱𝗲𝗻𝗰𝗶𝗲𝘀 - Setting up the build environment.<br>
𝗥𝘂𝗻 𝗧𝗲𝘀𝘁 𝗖𝗮𝘀𝗲𝘀 - Ensuring code quality.<br>
𝗦𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗿 𝗔𝗻𝗮𝗹𝘆𝘀𝗶𝘀 - Code quality checks.<br>
𝗧𝗿𝗶𝘃𝘆 𝗙𝗦 𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗻 - Security scanning for dependencies.<br>
𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 - Compiling the application.<br>
𝗕𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱 & 𝗧𝗮𝗴 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲 - Dockerizing the application.<br>
𝗦𝗰𝗮𝗻 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲 𝗨𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗧𝗿𝗶𝘃𝘆 - Ensuring image security.<br>
𝗣𝘂𝘀𝗵 𝗗𝗼𝗰𝗸𝗲𝗿 𝗜𝗺𝗮𝗴𝗲 - Uploading to Docker registry.<br>
𝗗𝗲𝗽𝗹𝗼𝘆 𝗔𝗽𝗽𝗹𝗶𝗰𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝗞𝘂𝗯𝗲𝗿𝗻𝗲𝘁𝗲𝘀 using ARGOCD operator - Orchestrating deployment.<br>
